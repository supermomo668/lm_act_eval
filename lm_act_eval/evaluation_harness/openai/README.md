# Integrating GPT-V Vision Evaluation as a Custom Metric in Hugging Face

In addition to standalone evaluations, the `GPTVScorer` from the `lm_act_eval` library can be seamlessly integrated as a custom metric within the Hugging Face Trainer workflow. This section guides you through adapting `GPTVScorer` for use with Hugging Face, focusing on scenarios where the evaluation input is a `pandas.DataFrame`.

## Adapting GPTVScorer for Hugging Face

To integrate `GPTVScorer` as a custom metric function in Hugging Face, you’ll need to wrap its functionality to match the signature expected by Hugging Face’s `compute_metrics` callback. This involves adapting the evaluation process to work with model predictions and a dataset represented as a DataFrame.

### Step 1: Define the Custom Metric Function

Define a function that converts the predictions from your Hugging Face Trainer into a DataFrame format expected by `GPTVScorer`, and then invokes the scorer to perform the evaluation:

```python
from transformers import EvalPrediction
import pandas as pd
from lm_act_eval.evaluation_harness.openai.vision.evaluator import GPTVScorer
from lm_act_eval.evaluation_harness.openai.vision.conf import GPTVConfig

def gptv_metrics(eval_inputs, eval_state):
“”"
Adapts the GPTVScorer for use as a Hugging Face Trainer compute_metrics function.
“”"
# Placeholder for converting logits and labels into a DataFrame suitable for GPTVScorer
# logits, labels = eval_pred.predictions, eval_pred.label_ids
# Example conversion (customize this according to your specific needs)
# predictions = logits.argmax(-1)

query, goal, screenshot = get_fields(eval_inputs)
screenshot = get_screenshot(eval_state)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'QUERY': [],  # Populate with actual queries from your dataset
    'GOAL': [],   # Populate with actual goals from your dataset
    'screenshot': []  # Populate with actual screenshot paths/URLs from your dataset
})

evaluator = GPTVScorer(GPTVConfig)

# Perform the evaluation
evaluation_results = evaluator(df)

return evaluation_result
```

### Step 2: Integrate with Hugging Face Trainer

Supply your custom `compute_vision_metrics` function to the `compute_metrics` parameter of the `Trainer`:

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
output_dir="./results",
evaluation_strategy=“epoch”,
# Additional TrainingArguments as needed
)

trainer = Trainer(
model=model,
args=training_args,
train_dataset=train_dataset,
eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
compute_metrics=gptv_metrics # Your custom compute_metrics function
)

trainer.evaluate()
```

### Customization Notes

**Data Preparation**: Adapt the data preparation step within `compute_vision_metrics` to convert your model’s predictions and the associated metadata (e.g., queries, goals, screenshots) into a DataFrame format compatible with `GPTVScorer`.
**Result Processing**: Customize how you process the evaluation results from `GPTVScorer` into the metrics dictionary returned by `compute_vision_metrics`, ensuring it matches the format expected by your evaluation workflow.
## Conclusion

By adapting `GPTVScorer` for use as a custom metric in Hugging Face, you can leverage its advanced vision evaluation capabilities directly within your training and evaluation pipelines. This integration enriches the feedback loop during model development, enabling a more nuanced understanding of model performance in visually-augmented tasks.
